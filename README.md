# 🕹️ CyberPalm 2048

**CyberPalm 2048** is a futuristic twist on the classic 2048 puzzle game — controlled by your **hand gestures** using your webcam, or with traditional **keyboard arrows** if you're feeling retro.

Built with a **cyberpunk theme**, this project uses **real-time hand tracking** powered by [Google's HandLandmarker.js](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) (part of Google AI’s MediaPipe) — no frameworks, no fluff, just raw **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
